A simple library that allows PHP projects to communicate with JasperServer using SOAP.
Just plug it into your project and you will easily can generate your jasper reports stored into an JasperServer

If you need, ping me.

TODO List:

- Improve exception handler for PHP functions errors, warnings and so on;
- Create an autoloader 
- Write some documentation (PHPDoc also)
- Write Unit Tests

Usage example (look the complete sample code at index.php):

try {
	$jasper = new Adl\Integration\RequestJasper();
	/*
	To send output to browser
	*/
	header('Content-type: application/pdf');
	echo $jasper->run('/reports/samples/AllAccounts',$formatType = 'PDF');
	
	/*
	To Save content to a file in the disk
	The path where the file will be saved is registered into config/data.ini
	*/
	//$jasper->runReport('/reports/samples/AllAccounts',$formatType = 'PDF', null, true);

} catch (\Exception $e) {
	echo $e->getMessage();
	die;
}
